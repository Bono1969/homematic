Homematic Scripts
-----------------

The following are scripts I use in conjunction with my Homematic installation. I do tend not to use additional modules / software on my systems, so things should work without additions.


fritzbox presence script
------------------------

The script set or unsets the variables on a CCU2 when a users presence is detected on the Fritz box. You can add devices by their IP Address or Ethernet address or even IP ranges for detection of guests for example.

Homematic Scripts
-----------------

The following are scripts I use in conjunction with my Homematic installation. I do tend not to use additional modules / software on my systems, so things should work without additions.


Router Presence Script
------------------------

This script runs on my router ( a fritz!box , but should work on any unix ).  The script set or unsets the variables on a CCU2 when a users presence is detected. You can add devices by their IP Address or Ethernet address or even IP ranges for detection of guests for example.
